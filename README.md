Developed by Nick Marriott

# RUNNING THE CODE
1. Open the project folder with a valid IDE such as PyCharm.
2. Configure ChessMain.py as the launch file.
3. Run the configuration. 

# VERSION RELEASE 1.0
The first version of chess is a two player based game. Moves such as castling, pawn promotion and en-passant are all currently working. However, please note that pawn promotion will automatically promote to a queen piece. In-game text is currently not available, thus instead will be displayed in the console output.

### Future Additions (coming soon)
* AI-Driven opponent
* Animation / possible move highlighting
* Move history export (to replay your game on other chess systems)
* Threading
* General bug fixes
